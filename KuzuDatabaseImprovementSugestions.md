# Kuzu Database Improvement Suggestions for MakeIndex

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive functionality review of MakeIndex, I have identified significant opportunities to enhance the generated Kuzu database with more complete AST information. While the current implementation provides a solid foundation with basic AST nodes, declarations, types, and relationships, there are substantial gaps that prevent users from being able to answer all queries about a C++ codebase purely from the database.

## Current Capabilities Analysis

### Strengths of Current Implementation

1. **Basic AST Structure**: Successfully captures fundamental AST node hierarchy with parent-child relationships
2. **Declaration Tracking**: Records named declarations with qualified names, access specifiers, and storage classes
3. **Type System**: Creates type nodes with basic information (builtin, const/volatile qualifiers)
4. **Template Support**: Identifies template declarations and specializations
5. **Scope Tracking**: Maintains namespace and function scope relationships
6. **Reference Tracking**: Links declarations to their usages (calls, references)
7. **Performance Optimization**: Uses batched operations for efficient database writes

### Database Schema Overview

The current schema includes:
- **ASTNode**: Base table for all AST nodes with type, location, and memory address
- **Declaration**: Named declarations with qualified names and context
- **Type**: Type information with qualifiers and categorization
- **Statement/Expression**: Basic statement and expression tracking
- **Relationships**: PARENT_OF, HAS_TYPE, REFERENCES, IN_SCOPE, TEMPLATE_RELATION

## Critical Missing Information

**IMPLEMENTED**: ✅ Function Bodies and Statement Detail enhancement has been completed and is now available in the current codebase. This included enhanced Statement and Expression table schemas with detailed information about control flow, operators, literals, and local variable declarations.

**IMPLEMENTED**: ✅ Inheritance and Class Hierarchy enhancement has been completed and is now available in the current codebase. This included INHERITS_FROM and OVERRIDES relationship tables in the database schema, along with comprehensive VisitCXXRecordDecl implementation to capture inheritance relationships, virtual function override chains, and multiple inheritance support.


**IMPLEMENTED**: ✅ Template System Enhancement has been completed and is now available in the current codebase. This included:
- Enhanced TemplateParameter node table with detailed parameter information (type, non-type, template parameters)
- SPECIALIZES relationship table with specialization kinds and template arguments
- Template parameter extraction from template declarations
- Enhanced template specialization tracking for both function and class templates
- Support for partial specializations and instantiation contexts

### 2. Preprocessor and Macro Information **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]**

**Current State**: No preprocessor information is captured

**Missing Information**:
- Macro definitions and their expansions
- Include file relationships and order
- Conditional compilation (#if/#ifdef)
- Pragma directives
- Header guard analysis

**Impact**: Cannot analyze:
- Build dependency graphs
- Macro usage patterns
- Include optimization opportunities
- Platform-specific code paths

### 3. Comments and Documentation **[LOW PRIORITY]**

**Current State**: Comments are not captured

**Missing Information**:
- Function and class documentation comments
- TODO/FIXME/HACK markers
- Doxygen-style documentation
- License headers

**Impact**: Cannot generate:
- API documentation
- Code quality reports
- Developer annotations analysis

### 4. Namespace and Using Declarations **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]**

**Current State**: Basic namespace context is captured but using declarations are incomplete

**Missing Information**:
- Using directives scope and impact
- Namespace aliases resolution
- Argument-dependent lookup (ADL) relationships
- Using declarations for specific symbols

**Suggested Enhancement**:
```sql
CREATE NODE TABLE UsingDeclaration(
    node_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
    using_kind STRING,          -- "directive", "declaration", "alias"
    target_name STRING,
    introduces_name STRING,
    scope_impact STRING
)
```

### 5. Memory Management and Resource Analysis **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]**

**Missing Information**:
- new/delete expression tracking
- RAII pattern identification
- Smart pointer usage
- Memory allocation/deallocation pairs
- Resource acquisition and release patterns

### 6. Constant Expression and Compile-Time Evaluation **[LOW PRIORITY]**

**Missing Information**:
- constexpr function evaluation results
- Template metaprogramming evaluation
- Compile-time constant values
- Static assertion information


## Specific Implementation Recommendations

The following recommendations focus on the remaining high-priority improvements after the successful implementation of inheritance tracking.
