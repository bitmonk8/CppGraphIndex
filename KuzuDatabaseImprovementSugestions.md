# Kuzu Database Improvement Suggestions for MakeIndex

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive functionality review of MakeIndex, I have identified significant opportunities to enhance the generated Kuzu database with more complete AST information. While the current implementation provides a solid foundation with basic AST nodes, declarations, types, and relationships, there are substantial gaps that prevent users from being able to answer all queries about a C++ codebase purely from the database.

## Current Capabilities Analysis

### Strengths of Current Implementation

1. **Basic AST Structure**: Successfully captures fundamental AST node hierarchy with parent-child relationships
2. **Declaration Tracking**: Records named declarations with qualified names, access specifiers, and storage classes
3. **Type System**: Creates type nodes with basic information (builtin, const/volatile qualifiers)
4. **Template Support**: Identifies template declarations and specializations
5. **Scope Tracking**: Maintains namespace and function scope relationships
6. **Reference Tracking**: Links declarations to their usages (calls, references)
7. **Performance Optimization**: Uses batched operations for efficient database writes

### Database Schema Overview

The current schema includes:
- **ASTNode**: Base table for all AST nodes with type, location, and memory address
- **Declaration**: Named declarations with qualified names and context
- **Type**: Type information with qualifiers and categorization
- **Statement/Expression**: Basic statement and expression tracking
- **Relationships**: PARENT_OF, HAS_TYPE, REFERENCES, IN_SCOPE, TEMPLATE_RELATION

## Critical Missing Information

### 1. Constant Expression and Compile-Time Evaluation **[LOW PRIORITY]**

**Missing Information**:
- constexpr function evaluation results
- Template metaprogramming evaluation
- Compile-time constant values
- Static assertion information
